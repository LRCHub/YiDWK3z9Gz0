[00:00.13] This is one small step for woman
[00:02.90] One giant leap for woman-kind
[00:17.40] 
[00:10.57] I'd rather be alone tonight
[00:13.15] You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
[00:16.42] Really don't wanna be in your arms tonight
[00:19.40] I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
[00:22.75] Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
[00:25.91] Ain't no checkin' on when I get home tonight
[00:29.17] Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
[00:32.21] Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
[00:54.71] 
[00:35.56] Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
[00:37.18] I can't really miss you if I'm with you
[00:39.79] And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
[00:43.07] Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
[00:46.20] It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A
[01:10.20] 
[00:49.83] Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
[00:53.01] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
[00:55.41] You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
[00:59.38] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
[01:02.50] Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
[01:05.75] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
[01:08.35] You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
[01:12.45] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
[01:36.45] 
[01:15.55] Bottom line
[01:17.08] Usually I would love it if you stay the night
[01:20.33] I just think I'm on another page tonight
[01:23.32] It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
[01:28.13] Usually I would orbit around you
[01:31.38] But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
[01:36.33] You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm
[02:04.83] 
[01:40.60] Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
[01:43.72] And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
[01:46.93] Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
[01:50.18] It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A
[02:14.18] 
[01:53.87] Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
[01:57.25] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
[01:59.59] You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
[02:03.23] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
[02:06.77] Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
[02:09.76] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
[02:12.25] You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
[02:16.23] I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)
[02:40.23] 
[02:19.55] You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
[02:25.94] Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
[02:32.30] You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
[02:35.56] (You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover)
[02:38.87] Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
[02:41.91] (Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under)
[03:10.41] 
[02:45.08] Alone tonight, hmm
[02:49.85] You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
[02:54.02] Ohh, mmm
