It's common sense to turn against a world
That's quick to mock and slow to bless success
(Get a little bit higher, baby)
Return to form and be reborn
The words are only worth the ones that you can manifest
(Get a little bit higher, higher, baby, baby)

Anything you want, anything you need
Just relax (you can get it)
You got everything you want, everything you need
Just relax

Right on time, we're electrified
Like spirits in the static, we've been under the lights
Oh, my my, from Earth to the sky
We keep on fallin' like we'rе learnin' to fly

(Let me run this thing back for a minutе)
(Let me run this thing)
(I can feel a climax in the moment, liftin' gravity)

Ooo, I can tell we're on the level
Let's get higher
I can feel it comin' on
Can you tell me what you're thinkin'?
'Cause I think we're comin' up too fast
Just relax

Right on time, we're electrified
Like spirits in the static, we've been under the lights
Oh, my my, from Earth to the sky
We keep on fallin' like we're learnin' to fly

I got something to say that's been on my mind
We've been wastin' away
We've been wasted
I'm just tryin' to say
You got to fall to fly in this game that we ride

Right on time, we're electrified
Like spirits in the static, we've been under the lights
Oh, my my, from Earth to the sky
We keep on fallin' like we're learnin' to fly

We keep fallin' like we're learnin' to fly
We keep on fallin' like we're learnin' to fly
