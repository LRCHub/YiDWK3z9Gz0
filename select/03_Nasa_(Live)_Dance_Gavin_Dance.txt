Staring at the window panes
Russian roulette with some names on the phone

When I stare at your face, are you even alive?

Oh my god, you're so fucking intelligent
Don't you just love the use of Andy Warhol

We always know that we were never the best advocates
It's okay
From gray to red

Holy fuck, I'm impressed
Too bad I don't have a pussy to partake
While I sit here in sermon chairs
Here's our Nobel Prize, let's gamble our demise

Staring at the window panes
Russian roulette with some names on the phone
Hey you, where you from?
Nevermind, just leave me alone

I drained the wells, so the town has no water
I cut the powerlines and buried the graves
I drank the blood from the fortunate ones
And self-destruction 'cause we're all the same

Hurry up, trading the gold for cash
That's what everyone's saying
Don't blame me for post-economical backlash
That's what everybody's doing
Sometimes, I can't believe myself
Consequences in the purest form
I see them coming from miles away

I'm down with brown town
It's only seconds away
